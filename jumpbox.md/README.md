# Windows 11 Jump Box

## Purpose
This VM serves as a secure management workstation used to access and administer internal lab systems.

## What I Built
- Centralized admin access point
- RDP/SSH access to internal servers
- Browser-based management (pfSense, Security Onion, etc.)
- Simulated help desk / IT admin workflow

## Architecture Overview
The Jump Box is the only machine allowed to directly manage sensitive infrastructure components, enforcing a least-privilege model.

## Key Configurations
- Domain-joined (if applicable)
- Admin tools installed
- Hardened access policies
- Restricted firewall rules
